# IA_DeepLearning_Course

I am learning through a course by Santiago Hernandez,

https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-from-zero-en-python/learn/lecture/23711342#overview

I will save exercises, notes, programs in python3.11, Jupyter Notebooks. There is a little bit of everything related to deeplearning and machine learning with python3, from Natural language processing, real-time facial recognition using a camera, image classification using neural networks, examples of using pandas, dask, numpy, matplotlib and the rest of the interesting python libraries that you find relevant to learn.
